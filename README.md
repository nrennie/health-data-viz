# Visualising Health

This repository contains the code used to produce visualisations of health-related data.

## Data

All visualisations use open-source datasets. As such, the datasets themselves are not included in this repository and links to the original sources are provided instead.

Below are a list of places to find health-related data (primarily for the UK):

* [NHS Digital](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/statistical-publications-open-data-and-data-products)

* [UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/)

### Sources
